```

### 2. **Backend Setup**

```sh
cd Backend
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create a .env file with your OpenAI and backend API keys:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# BACKEND_API_KEY=mysecret123
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 3. **Frontend Setup**

```sh
cd ../Frontend-Summary-Generator

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

- All backend endpoints require a valid API key in the `Authorization` header.
- PII masking is available for anonymizing emails, phone numbers, and SSNs.

---

## Toast Notifications

- Uses [Sonner] via shadcn/ui for all notifications simulation.
- Example:  
  `toast("Summary copied to clipboard!")`

---

## Tech Notes

- **RichEditor** uses TipTap with a custom toolbar for formatting.
- **Auto-save** in `NotesEditor` saves notes to localStorage every second after typing stops.
- **API call** logic is in `src/lib/api.ts` for maintainability.

---

## Future Scope & Possible Enhancements

- **Advanced PII Masking:**  
  Integrate NLP-based PII detection libraries (e.g., spaCy, Presidio) for more robust anonymization of sensitive information beyond regex patterns.

- **User Authentication:**  
  Add user accounts and authentication (e.g., with JWT or OAuth) to allow clinicians to securely save and manage their summaries.

- **Session History & Storage:**  
  Allow users to view, edit, and export previous session summaries. Integrate with a database for persistent storage.

- **Export Options:**  
  Support exporting summaries as PDF, DOCX, or direct EHR integration.
